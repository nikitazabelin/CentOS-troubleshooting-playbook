<summary>Disk space full error</summary>

## Introduction
When the disk space on your CentOS system is full, you may encounter errors when trying to write to or access files on the disk. This can cause your system to slow down or even crash, and it can also prevent you from installing or updating software packages.

In this guide, we'll show you how to identify when your disk space is running low, and how to free up disk space so that your system can function properly.

## Identifying the Problem
The first step in troubleshooting disk space issues is to identify whether this is the cause of the problem you're encountering. Here are some common signs that your disk space is running low:

- You receive error messages indicating that there is no space left on the disk.
- Your system runs slowly or freezes up, especially when trying to access or write to files.
- You're unable to install or update software packages due to insufficient disk space.

To check the available disk space on your CentOS system, you can use the df command:

```
df -h
``` 

This will display the disk usage information for all mounted file systems, including the amount of free space available.

If the output shows that your disk is almost full or completely full, you'll need to free up some space in order to resolve the issue.


## Freeing Up Disk Space
There are several ways to free up disk space on a CentOS system. Here are some common methods:

### 1. Clean up log files
Log files can take up a lot of disk space over time, especially if they're not rotated or deleted regularly. You can use the logrotate command to manage log files on your system:

```
sudo logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.conf
```
This will force logrotate to run and clean up any old log files.

### 2. Delete temporary files
Temporary files can also consume a lot of disk space. You can use the tmpwatch command to automatically delete files in the system's temporary directories that are older than a certain number of days:

```
sudo tmpwatch 7 /tmp
sudo tmpwatch 7 /var/tmp
```
This will remove any files in the /tmp and /var/tmp directories that are more than 7 days old.

### 3. Uninstall unused software and other big files
Uninstalling software that you no longer need can also free up disk space. You can use the yum package manager to remove packages that you no longer need:

```
sudo yum remove package-name
```
Replace package-name with the name of the package that you want to remove.

You can also use these commands to find big files and remove them if it is possible
```
find / -mount -size +8096 -ls
find / -mount -name core -ls
du -sh /* (repeat for subsequent dirs on /)
```

### 4. Clear the YUM cache
The yum package manager caches downloaded packages in order to speed up future installations. However, this cache can consume a significant amount of disk space over time. You can clear the YUM cache by running the following command:

```
sudo yum clean all
```
### 5. Resize the disk partition
If none of the above methods work or if you need more space than you can free up, you can resize the disk partition to increase its capacity. However, this process can be risky and should only be attempted by experienced users.

### Conclusion
By following the above steps, you should be able to free up disk space on your CentOS system and resolve any disk space-related issues that you may encounter. If you continue to experience issues after trying these steps, it's recommended to seek help from a qualified Linux administrator.

Before you begin, make sure that your disk has enough free space. A full disk can cause file system corruption, so ensure that you have enough free space to work with.

You can check the disk usage on your system by running the following command:

```
df -h
```

This will show you the disk usage in human-readable format. Look for any file system that has a high usage percentage or is at 100% capacity. If you find any such file system, you may need to delete unnecessary files or expand the file system to free up space.

### 2. Run File System Check
Next, you can run a file system check to detect and repair any file system errors. CentOS uses the fsck utility for file system checks.

To run a file system check on your root file system, boot your system into recovery mode and select the option to run a file system check. Alternatively, you can run the following command to check the file system when the system is running:

```
sudo fsck -f /dev/sdaX
```
Replace /dev/sdaX with the device file of the file system you want to check. This will run a file system check and attempt to fix any errors it finds.

### 3. Restore from Backup
If the file system check doesn't resolve the issue, and you have a backup of your system, you can restore the file system from the backup. This will help you recover your data and get your system up and running again.

### 4. Reinstall the Operating System
If none of the above steps work, and you don't have a backup, you may need to reinstall the operating system. This will wipe your system and install a fresh copy of CentOS. Remember to backup your data before proceeding with a reinstallation.

### Conclusion
File system corruption can cause data loss and system instability, but following the steps in this guide can help you troubleshoot and fix the issue on your CentOS system. Remember to regularly backup your data to avoid losing important files in case of any future file system corruption issues.

<summary>Permission issues (e.g., unable to modify or delete files, unable to execute certain commands)</summary>

## Issue

Permission issues can occur in CentOS when a user is unable to modify or delete files, or execute certain commands. This can happen due to incorrect ownership or permissions set on files and directories, or due to configuration issues with sudo privileges.

## Symptoms

- "Permission Denied" error messages when trying to modify or delete files
- Inability to execute certain commands or scripts
- Errors when trying to view or access certain files
- "Operation not permitted" error messages
## Solution

1. Checking Permissions and Ownership
Check the ownership and permissions of the file or directory using the ls -l command. This will display the file permissions, owner, group, and file size.
```
ls -l /path/to/file
```
2. If the file ownership or permissions are incorrect, use the chown and chmod commands to change them. For example, to change the ownership of a file to a different user, use:
```
sudo chown new_user /path/to/file
```
To change the permissions of a file to allow read, write, and execute access to the owner and read-only access to everyone else, use:
```
sudo chmod 755 /path/to/file
```

Add the following line to allow the user to run the desired command:
```
username ALL=(ALL) /path/to/command
```
Replace username with the actual username and ```/path/to/command``` with the actual path to the command.
### Checking SELinux Settings
1. Check if SELinux is enabled and enforcing using the sestatus command. This will display the current status of SELinux.
```
$ sestatus
```
2. If SELinux is enabled and enforcing, check the SELinux context of the file or directory using the ls -Z command. This will display the SELinux context of the file or directory.
```
ls -Z /path/to/file
```
3. If the SELinux context is incorrect, use the chcon command to change it. For example, to set the SELinux context of a file to allow read, write, and execute access to the owner and read-only access to everyone else, use:
```
sudo chcon -t httpd_sys_content_rw_t /path/to/file
```
Replace ```/path/to/file``` with the actual path to the file.
## Conclusion

By following these steps, you should be able to troubleshoot and resolve permission issues in CentOS. If the issue persists, you may need to seek further assistance from a system administrator or online forums.

<summary>System performance issues (e.g., high CPU or memory usage, slow disk I/O)</summary>

## Introduction

CentOS is a popular Linux distribution that is widely used in production environments. However, like any other operating system, it may encounter performance issues that can affect the overall system performance. These issues may include high CPU or memory usage, slow disk I/O, or other related issues that can significantly impact the system's performance.

In this guide, we will cover some common performance issues encountered in CentOS and provide some troubleshooting steps to resolve them.

## Identifying System Performance Issues

Before we proceed with the troubleshooting steps, we need to first identify the performance issues affecting the system. Some common symptoms of performance issues include:

- Slow response time when launching applications or accessing files
- High CPU or memory usage, which can be checked using the top command
- Slow disk I/O, which can be checked using the iostat command
- Network-related issues, such as slow download or upload speeds
- Once we have identified the symptoms, we can proceed with the troubleshooting steps.

## Troubleshooting Steps

### Step 1: Check System Resources
The first step in resolving performance issues is to check the system resources. We need to ensure that the system has enough CPU, memory, and disk space available. We can check the CPU and memory usage using the top command, and the disk space usage using the ```df -h``` command.

### Step 2: Check for Resource-Intensive Processes
If we notice that the system resources are being consumed excessively, we need to identify the processes responsible for this. We can use the ```top``` command to sort the processes by CPU or memory usage and identify the resource-intensive processes.

Once we have identified the resource-intensive processes, we can consider terminating or limiting their resource usage using tools like renice or cpulimit.

### Step 3: Check Disk I/O
Slow disk I/O can significantly impact system performance. We can use the ```iostat``` command to check the disk I/O and identify any bottlenecks.

If we notice high disk I/O usage, we can consider optimizing the disk usage by moving frequently accessed files to a faster disk or using a RAID configuration.

### Step 4: Optimize Network Settings
If we encounter slow network speeds, we can check the network settings and identify any bottlenecks. We can use tools like ```ping``` and ```traceroute``` to identify network issues and optimize the network settings accordingly.

### Step 5: Optimize System Settings
We can also optimize the system settings to improve the system performance. This may include tweaking kernel parameters or disabling unnecessary system services.

## Conclusion

Performance issues can significantly impact the system performance and affect the overall user experience. However, by following the troubleshooting steps outlined in this guide, we can effectively identify and resolve performance issues on CentOS.

<summary>SELinux-related permission denied errors</summary>

## Introduction
Sometimes when using CentOS, you might encounter permission denied errors when attempting to perform certain actions, such as accessing a file or running a command. These errors can often be caused by SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) restrictions, which are designed to provide additional security to your system.

## How to identify SELinux permission denied errors

SELinux permission denied errors are often accompanied by error messages that indicate that the action you are trying to perform has been denied due to security policies. These messages may also include references to SELinux, such as "SELinux is preventing...".

To determine if an error is related to SELinux, you can check the system logs using the following command:

```
sudo tail -f /var/log/messages
```
You may see messages related to SELinux policy denials, such as:

```
type=AVC msg=audit(1509415626.029:354): avc: denied { read } for pid=3265 comm="httpd" name="index.html" dev=dm-0 ino=524303 scontext=system_u:system_r:httpd_t:s0 tcontext=unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0 tclass=file
```
This message indicates that the httpd process was denied read access to the file "index.html" due to SELinux policies.

## How to troubleshoot SELinux permission denied errors

There are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve SELinux permission denied errors:

### 1. Check SELinux status
The first step is to check the status of SELinux using the following command:

```
sudo sestatus
```
If SELinux is enabled, the output will indicate that it is in enforcing mode:

```
SELinux status:                 enabled
SELinuxfs mount:                /sys/fs/selinux
SELinux root directory:         /etc/selinux
Loaded policy name:             targeted
Current mode:                   enforcing
Mode from config file:          enforcing
Policy MLS status:              enabled
Policy deny_unknown status:     allowed
Max kernel policy version:      31
```
If SELinux is not enabled, you can skip the remaining steps.

### 2. Identify the SELinux context of the file or command
You can use the "ls -Z" command to display the SELinux context of a file or command:

```
ls -Z /path/to/file
ls -Z `which command`
```
The output will include information about the SELinux context, such as:

```
-rw-r--r--. root root unconfined_u:object_r:admin_home_t:s0 /path/to/file
-rwxr-xr-x. root root system_u:object_r:bin_t:s0       /usr/bin/command
```
### 3. Adjust the SELinux context of the file or command
If the SELinux context of the file or command is incorrect, you can adjust it using the "chcon" command:

````
sudo chcon -t type /path/to/file
sudo chcon -t type `which command`
```
Replace "type" with the correct SELinux context type for the file or command. You can find a list of context types in the SELinux policy file.

### 4. Create an SELinux policy module
If you need to make a more permanent change to the SELinux policies, you can create an SELinux policy module using the "audit2allow" command:

```
sudo grep denied /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2allow -M mypol
sudo semodule -i mypol.pp
```
The audit2allow command can help you generate the necessary policy rules based on the denied permission logs from step 2.

### 5. Adjust existing SELinux policy:
You can adjust the existing SELinux policy to allow access to a specific resource or process. This involves modifying the policy rules in the SELinux policy file. It is recommended to make these changes in a custom policy file instead of modifying the system policy file directly.

### 6. Temporarily disable SELinux:
You can temporarily disable SELinux to test whether it is the source of the permission denied errors. However, this is not recommended for long-term use as it can compromise the security of your system.

## Conclusion
SELinux-related permission denied errors can be frustrating to diagnose and resolve, but understanding how SELinux works and how to adjust the policy can help you quickly get your CentOS system back up and running. By following the troubleshooting steps outlined above, you can identify the source of the issue and implement the appropriate solution
